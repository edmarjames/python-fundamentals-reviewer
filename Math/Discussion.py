# Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

# The "min()" and "max()" functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable.
print(max(1, 10, 4))
print(min(99, 43, 12))

print("\r")
# The "abs()" function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number.
print(abs(-15))

print("\r")
# The "pow()" function returns the value of x to the power of y.
print(pow(2, 3))

print("\r")
# The Math module
# Python has also a built-in module called "math", which extends the list of mathematical functions.
# The "math.sqrt()" method returns the square root of a number.
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))

print("\r")
# The "math.ceil()" method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the "math.floor()" method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result.
print(math.ceil(8.8))
print(math.floor(5.4))

print("\r")
# The "math.pi" constant, returns the value of PI
print(math.pi)
