# 1. Creating Tuples
# Create a tuple shapes with the values "Circle", "Square", and "Triangle".
# Create a tuple using the tuple() constructor with values "Red", "Green", and "Blue".
# Expected Output:
# ('Circle', 'Square', 'Triangle')
# ('Red', 'Green', 'Blue')


# 2. Accessing Items
# Access the second item of the shapes tuple.
# Access the last item using negative indexing.
# Expected Output:
# Square
# Triangle


# 3. Slicing Tuples
# Retrieve the first two items from the shapes tuple.
# Get all items from the second item to the end.
# Expected Output:
# ('Circle', 'Square')
# ('Square', 'Triangle')


# 4. Check Item Existence
# Check if "Circle" is in the shapes tuple.
# Expected Output:
# True


# 5. Modify Tuples (Workaround)
# Convert the shapes tuple to a list, add the item "Hexagon", then convert it back to a tuple.
# Expected Output:
# ('Circle', 'Square', 'Triangle', 'Hexagon')


# 6. Unpacking Tuples
# Unpack the shapes tuple into three variables shape1, shape2, and shape3.
# Use the * operator to unpack the shapes tuple so that the first item is assigned to one variable, and the remaining items are assigned to another variable as a list.
# Expected Output:
# Circle Square Triangle
# Circle ['Square', 'Triangle']


# 7. Looping through Tuples
# Loop through the shapes tuple using:
# A for loop.
# A while loop.
# Expected Output:
# Circle
# Square
# Triangle

# Circle
# Square
# Triangle


# 8. Joining Tuples
# Join two tuples brands1 = ("Nike", "Adidas") and brands2 = ("Puma", "Reebok") using the + operator.
# Expected Output:
# ('Nike', 'Adidas', 'Puma', 'Reebok')


# 9. Multiplying Tuples
# Multiply the brands1 tuple by 3 using the * operator.
# Expected Output:
# ('Nike', 'Adidas', 'Nike', 'Adidas', 'Nike', 'Adidas')
