# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
# Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories
    # Text type: str
    # Numeric types: int, float, complex
    # Sequence types: list, tuple range
    # Mapping type: dict
    # Set types: set, frozenset
    # Boolean type: bool
    # Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
    # None type: NoneType

# Getting the data types
# You can get the data type of any object by using the "type()" function:
a = 16
print(type(a))

# Setting the data type
# In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable
