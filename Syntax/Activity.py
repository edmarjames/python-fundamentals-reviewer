# Create a Python script that:

# Prints the following sentence: "Python is fun!"
# Then checks if a variable x = 20 is greater than y = 10 and prints "x is greater than y" if true.
# Use proper indentation and include a case where improper indentation would lead to an error (as a comment).

x = 20
y = 10

print("Python is fun!")

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
        # this case would lead to an error since the indentation is improper
        # print("improper indentation")
