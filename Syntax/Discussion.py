# Execute Python Syntax

# Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command line
# >>> print("Hello World")
# Hello World

# Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
print("Hello World")


# Python Indentation
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
if 10 > 5:
    print("Ten is greater than five")

# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
if 10 > 5:
print("Ten is greater than five")

# The number of space is up to you, the most common use is four.
# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 10 > 5:
    print("Ten is greater than five")
        print("10 is greater than 5")
