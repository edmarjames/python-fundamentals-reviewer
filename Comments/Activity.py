# Write a Python script that:

# Prints "I am learning Python" and includes comments that explain what each part of your code does.
# Add a multiline comment explaining how comments can be used.
# At the end of the script, comment out a line of code that prints "This should not be printed".

# This line prints a sentence
print("I am learning Python")

"""
Comments in Python can be used as a documentation wherein you as a developer can explain certain parts of your code so that it can be easily understand by other developers. 

Comments can also prevent a line of code to be executed during code testing.
