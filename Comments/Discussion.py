# Comments can be used to explain code, make the code more readable and can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

# Comments start with a #, and Python will ignore them
# This is a sample comment

# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line
print("Hello Earth") #This is a comment at the end of a line

# Comment does not have to be the text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code.
# print("I am reviewing Python Fundamentals")
print("NPC Arc starts today")


# Multiline comments

# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments. To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.
# comment 1
# comment 2
# comment 3

# You can also use a multiline string. Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string(triple quotes) in your code, and place your comments inside it.
"""This is a sample of multiline comment using triple quotes"""
