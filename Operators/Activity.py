# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# Perform the following arithmetic operations:
# Add 7 and 3
# Subtract 10 from 25
# Multiply 6 by 4
# Divide 15 by 3
# Find the modulus (remainder) when 14 is divided by 5
# Compute 2 raised to the power of 4
# Perform floor division of 22 by 7
# Expected Output:
# 10
# 15
# 24
# 5.0
# 4
# 16
# 3


# 2. Assignment Operators
# Start with x = 5 and perform the following assignments:
# Add 3 to x (x += 3)
# Subtract 2 from x (x -= 2)
# Multiply x by 4 (x *= 4)
# Divide x by 2 (x /= 2)
# Find the modulus when x is divided by 3 (x %= 3)
# Expected Output:
# 8
# 6
# 24
# 12.0
# 0.0


# 3. Comparison Operators
# Compare the following values and print the Boolean result:
# 7 == 7
# 5 != 10
# 8 > 12
# 15 < 20
# 25 >= 25
# 18 <= 12
# Expected Output:
# True
# True
# False
# True
# True
# False


# 4. Logical Operators
# Given x = 7 and y = 10, evaluate the following expressions:
# x == 7 and y == 10
# x == 5 or y == 10
# not(x == 7)
# Expected Output:
# True
# True
# False


# 5. Identity Operators
# Use the following variables: a = 5 and b = a. Test the identity of the variables:
# Check if a is b
# Check if a is not b
# Expected Output:
# True
# False


# 6. Membership Operators
# Given lst = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], test the following membership:
# Check if 4 is in lst
# Check if 7 is not in lst
# Expected Output:
# True
# True
