# Create a script that:

# Declares a variable for your name, age, and city.
# Prints these variables in a single sentence, e.g., "My name is John, I am 30 years old, and I live in New York."
# Use different variable naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case) for storing this information.

myName = "Edmar"
MyAge = 24
my_city = "Taguig City"

print(f"My name is {myName}, I am {MyAge} years old, and I live in {my_city}")
